# Formatting text with BBCode
Typing with normal text is fine, but it can fail to express some intentions properly. BBCode is a markup language (very similar to HTML) which allows controlled formatting of text. With it, text like [i]this[/i] and [u]this[/u] can easily be expressed, among other things. The syntax is composed of "tags," like \[b] and \[u], each with a "closing" counterpart, \[/b] and \[/u] in this case. When these tags surround some text, as in \[b]this\[/b], they change the way it looks. Multiple tags can surround one piece of text, combining their effects.

[b][size=117]Basic text styling:[/size][/b]
[hr][/hr]Bold:
\[b]text\[/b] -> [b]text[/b]
Italicized:[size=150][/size]
\[i]text\[/i] -> [i]text[/i]
Underlined:[size=150][/size]
\[u]text\[/u] -> [u]text[/u]
Struckthrough:[size=150][/size]
\[s]text\[/s] -> [s]text[/s]

[b][size=117]Changing size and color:[/size][/b]
[hr][/hr]Size is represented as a percentage of the regular size. Text can be as small as 20% or as large as 200%. To use the tag looks like:
\[size=130]text\[/size] -> [size=130]text[/size]
\[size=70]text\[/size] -> [size=70]text[/size]
[size=150][/size]Color is another way to format your text. You can use any common color (specifically HTML color) or a hex code:
\[color=red]text\[/color] -> [color=red]text[/color]
\[color=#6DC79E]text\[/color] -> [color=#6DC79E]text[/color]

[b][size=117]Linking things:[/size][/b]
[hr][/hr]Quite often, it is desirable to link another site. This can be done as:
\[url]https://google.com\[/url] -> [url]https://google.com[/url]
\[url=https://google.com]Google\[/url] -> [url=https://google.com]Google[/url]
[size=150][/size]Other times, it would be nice to embed an image from another site:
\[img]https://your.favorite.site/nice_image.png\[/img]
[size=150][/size]More rarely, you may wish to embed an email link that automatically opens up the viewer's email client:
\[email]abc@def.com\[/email] -> [email]abc@def.com[/email]

[b][size=117]Quoting and monospaced text:[/size][/b]
[hr][/hr]Emphasizing quoted text is easy, and it is optional to provide the quoted entity's name:
\[quote]Anonymous quote\[/quote] ->
[quote]Anonymous quote[/quote]
\[quote=Rob]Authored quote\[/quote] ->
[quote=Rob]Authored quote[/quote]
[size=120][/size]Sometimes, a monospaced font can help align things, or display code neatly:
\[code]Hello, world! This text is monospaced.\[/code] ->
[code]Hello, world! This text is monospaced.[/code][size=140][/size]
[b][size=117]Other information:[/size][/b]
[hr][/hr]All of the mentioned tags will span multiple lines (some might be capable of counterintuitive things). It is also possible to combine multiple tags for their style and functionality (\[img] might behave unexpectedly sometimes):
\[b]\[i]\[color=green]Hello! \[url=https://google.com]Google\[/url]\[/color] is my \[u]favorite\[/u] site.\[/i]\[/b] -> [b][i][color=green]Hello! [url=https://google.com]Google[/url][/color] is my [u]favorite[/u] site.[/i][/b]
