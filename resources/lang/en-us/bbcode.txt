# Formatting text with BBCode
Typing with normal text is fine, but it can fail to express some intentions properly. BBCode is a markup language (very similar to HTML) which allows controlled formatting of text. With it, text like [i]this[/i] and [u]this[/u] can easily be expressed, among other things. The syntax is composed of "tags," like \[b] and \[u], each with a "closing" counterpart, \[/b] and \[/u] in this case. When these tags surround some text, as in \[b]this\[/b], they change the way it looks. Multiple tags can surround one piece of text, combining their effects.

[b][size=117]Basic text styling:[/size][/b]
[hr][/hr]Bold:
\[b]text\[/b] -> [b]text[/b]
Italicized:[size=150][/size]
\[i]text\[/i] -> [i]text[/i]
Underlined:[size=150][/size]
\[u]text\[/u] -> [u]text[/u]
Struckthrough:[size=150][/size]
\[s]text\[/s] -> [s]text[/s]

[b][size=117]Changing size and color:[/size][/b]
[hr][/hr]Size is represented as a percentage of the regular size. Text can be as small as 20% or as large as 200%. To use the tag looks like:
\[size=130]text\[/size] -> [size=130]text[/size]
\[size=70]text\[/size] -> [size=70]text[/size]
[size=150][/size]Color is another way to format your text. You can use any common color (specifically HTML color) or a hex code:
\[color=red]text\[/color] -> [color=red]text[/color]
\[color=#8BE8BE]text\[/color] -> [color=#8BE8BE]text[/color]
