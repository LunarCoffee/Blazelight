# Does Canadian Healthcare Portray a Just Society?
Healthcare in Canada paints a very pleasant image for most in the country. Consistent affordability, accessibility, and quality across decades shows clear effort in maintaining a neutral system for all. These attributes encapsulate the idea of a Just Society, for instance being non-discriminatory against culture and providing equal opportunity for treatment and employment. As such, I believe the Canadian healthcare system does depict a Just Society.
[size=180][/size]With that out of the way, why should anyone care about having such a society in the first place? To illustrate, visualise a society in which [i]not[/i] everyone receives equal opportunity to flourish with no discrimination based on inherent characteristics. This society would be rather angering; imagine being unable to celebrate cultural traditions, work a dream profession, or receive lifesaving surgery without extra payment. No one wants to be in the oppressed group, and those who are feel cheated, heightening tension between citizens of the same nation. This serves no purpose in a productive, healthy, and supportive modern society, and thus a Just Society should be desired.
[size=180][/size]Returning to healthcare, the role it plays in a Just Society is instrumental. The ability to keep oneself in good health is fundamental, considering the relative unpredictability of human biology. Without healthcare, a simple flu could very well lead to death, and widespread illnesses like cancer and heart disease would ravage the population. In order to combat this, it is crucial for healthcare to be available to everyone, meaning it must be accessible and affordable, as our current system is.
[size=180][/size]This topic connects to me in a few ways, though more to the rest of my family. The only major health complication I've had is a case of acute appendicitis, which was handled brilliantly with a friendly experience with hospital staff and zero bill to pay. My parents, in particular my father, have naturally had more interactions with Canadian healthcare, and have found it extremely convenient that health insurance covers so much. As an immigrant family, we feel very comfortable, and as if we are being treated like anyone else.
[size=180][/size]As of now, Canadian healthcare represents a Just Society, though it very well may change in the near future. As the population grows, the amount of spending required to maintain the system will increase. Even in the eighties, there were people who doubted the sustainability of our healthcare, and today there are many more. Wait times and insufficient hospital space are simply adding fuel to the speculation. In the future, there is reasonable evidence to suggest that a fundamental change may occur, one which may threaten healthcare as part of a Just Society. To counter this, the citizens must pressure the government or any entity which proposes action threatening the integrity of the healthcare system. That is the most practical way.
[size=180][/size]Access to affordable healthcare is integral to a Just Society, providing treatments for dangerous illness, saving lives. On this front, Canada currently fares well, though funding may, among other potential issues, end up tearing it down.
